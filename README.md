# TTGO-T_DISPLAY-Cheerlights

Set of files to display clock on a TTGO-T-DISPLAY EPS32 device

### v1 MartinClock-Cheerlight-T-DISPLAY.ino

@martinbateman wrote a clock program for the T-DISPLAY - I modified it to use Cheerlights information

### v2 MB_Clock2_Cheerlights-TTGO-T-DISPLAY-Cheerlights.ino

@Martinbateman updated his clock algorthim/code so I merged in my cheerlights stuff into his code and this is result

### v3 MB_Clock3_Timezone-Cheerlights-TTGO-T-DISPLAY-Cheerlights.ino

Merged in automatic timezone code from @kd8bxp LeRoy Miller

### v4 MQTT-TTGO-T-DISPLAY

This version acts as just an MQTT receiver and executes TFT code from another computer/device
So all clever stuff can be done elsewhere and the board is just used as a WiFi capable display
